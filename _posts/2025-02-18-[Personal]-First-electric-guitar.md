After waiting for almost 1 month, I finally got (almost) the guitar. Thank god that mercari exist, cuz without it, I pbbly wouldnt even buy it. Now, only need pedals and TE non-tap Monstertone for the complete tone build

Check out the [Zenmarket](https://zenmarket.jp) If you want buy the guitar. Great proxy service.
