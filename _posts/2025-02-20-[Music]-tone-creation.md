Tried using [sergios (ac's) tone creation tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6G7SU6oBSo&t=119s). However NAM really fucked up my sound, also couldnt configure twin reverb on Amplitube 5, since on the video it is 4. However, renmiyo and others on disc channel said that sound on amp5 is better, so I just asked him for his settings. ALso If you use cracked amp5, it seems like you cannot import presets of the people who have licenced version. So thats another pain in the ass... 

Tried dokugaku's preset on amplitube 5 only. Works fine, just need to configure amp for my guitar.

Tried Dual pitch pitch shifter on helix for first death, sounds shitty. Maybe cuz of not configuring the sound, but idk. Hikaru's one was shitty as well, so dont have big hopes for that. I guess the only way to do it - is to buy eventide h9 with its pitchflex.
